# Conjugate heat transfer simulation of a 67-pebble core

*Contact: John Acierno (Penn State), Dillon Shaver (dshaver.at.anl.gov), and April Novak (anovak.at.anl.gov)* 

In this tutorial we are going to set up and simulate a simple [!ac](CHT) case using a helium (Pr=0.71) cooled 67-pebble bed.
This tutorial was developed from an example case provided with NekRS and couples to MOOSE's [!ac](CHT) module using CARDINAL as a wrapper. 
More information about the NEAMS tool CARDINAL can be found on [github](https://github.com/neams-th-coe/cardinal), or on the [Cardinal website](https://cardinal.cels.anl.gov/).
In each time step MOOSE will solve the energy equation in the the solid subdomain and pass the solution to NekRS, which will in-turn solve both the Navier-Stokes and energy equations in the fluid subdomain.
NekRS will then pass its temperature solve back to MOOSE in the next time step. 
This transfer of information occurs at the boundary between solid and fluid subdomains, which are the pebble surfaces in this case.

# Geometry and computational model

The geometry for this case consists of 67 pebbles in a randomly packed cylindrical bed.
The pebbles have a diameter of 1 (dimensionless) and the cylinder has a diameter of 4.4 (dimensionless).
The pebble bed begins around 2.5 pebble diameters upstream from the cylinder inlet and has a total heigh of about 5 pebble diameters.
A cross section of the fluid domain is shown in [pb67geom] where the fluid is the gray region and the pebbles are the white regions.

### Adding references style=font-size:125%

If the model has been previously published, one should provide the reference to the published works together with key references used for model development. 
+MooseDocs+ supports BibTex style references, and some examples about how to cite technical report, conference proceeding and journal article are given below.  

```language=bash
@techreport{Hu2017,
        address = {Lemont, IL},
        author = {Hu, Rui},

        mendeley-tags = {ANL/NE-17/4},
        institution = {Argonne National Laboratory},
        title = {{SAM Theory Manual}},
        year = {2017}
}

```

```language=bash

```


The bibtex entries must be added into the VTB bibliography file +vtb.bib+. 
A reference list will be generated automatically at the end of the VTB documentation page.

!alert note
More information is available online about [the list of NEAMS codes](https://neams.inl.gov/code-descriptions/) and the codes that have been used for [the models available in VTB repository](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/virtual_test_bed/resources/codes_used.html).
